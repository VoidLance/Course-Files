Markup Language: HTML uses tags to define elements within a document.
Structure: HTML documents are structured hierarchically, with a clear parent-child relationship between elements. This structure is essential for browseres to render content correctly.
An element consists of: opening tag <body> content, and a closing tag </body>
They can have attributes to provide additional information <a href="link.com">Link</a>
