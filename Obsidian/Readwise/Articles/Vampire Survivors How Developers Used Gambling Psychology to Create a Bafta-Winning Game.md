  The trailer for Vampire Survivors.
  This psychological appeal is not accidental. Game designer Luca Galante has applied [his previous experience in the gambling industry](https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante) to Vampire Survivors.

  The resulting game distils the essence of compelling, [“just-one-more-go” game design](https://www.gamesradar.com/just-one-more-go-science-and-psychology-destroying-your-sleep-patterns/) and provides a foundation for a new sub genre in the gaming landscape.
  The aim of Vampire Survivors is to survive as long as possible against swarms of monsters. The gameplay only requires directional controls for moving your character. Attacking monsters is automatic, with attacks triggering at frequent intervals, while upgrades increase their frequency, power and range.
  This deceptively simple structure creates a [game feel](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-feel-the-secret-ingredient) that may be best described as a dance between the player and enemy hordes. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hej9wwtkscfvegws299akc58))
- The [Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction Model](https://immersyve.com/white-paper-the-player-experience-of-need-satisfaction-pens-2007/) explains three key psychological needs games can fulfil and the player enjoyment and satisfaction experienced when they do.
  Vampire Survivors efficiently addresses two of these: competence (a sense of power and mastery) and autonomy (a sense of freedom).
  The game is built around multilayered rewards. In each run, players collect gold. Between runs, they spend that gold to enhance their character’s abilities. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01hej9xc3wx47njy4ewfnper5n))
