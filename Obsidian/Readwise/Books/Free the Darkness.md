## Highlights
- Relief washed over the weary rider as his destination finally emerged from the gloomy, moonlit darkness. ([Location 87](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019YM2E62&location=87))
    - Note: Great opening sentence, if a little cliche
- Tree branches creaked at the night’s gentle exhale. It was soft and passive, so unlike the aggressive sucking pops and sloughs of the mud pulling at his mount’s hooves. ([Location 89](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019YM2E62&location=89))
    - Note: Great use of comparison to establish feeling
- As his horse plodded closer to the foreboding fortress, his future’s fortunes once again flashed across his mind. ([Location 99](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019YM2E62&location=99))
    - Note: Actual alliteration in a fantasy novel?!
- If he ran, he would be hunted, and it would not be long before one of them would snuff out his life. ([Location 105](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B019YM2E62&location=105))
    - Note: The use of -them- is fantastic here, it creates a feeling of wanting to find out who -they- are, and why the character is afraid of them. It's a classic, but well-used
